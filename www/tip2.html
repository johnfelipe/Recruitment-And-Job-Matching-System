      Show your resourcefulness.
    </div>
    <div class="normalText">
      “I like to see that students have reached out to their college or university alumni who now work at Morgan Stanley. It shows they’re resourceful, have initiative and are self-starters. You can also ask alumni questions you might feel uncomfortable asking a recruiter.”
    </div>
    <div class="boldSection">
      Stay calm and keep listening.
    </div>
    <div class="normalText">
      “There are group exercises that are designed to simulate problem solving under pressure. We look for people who can stay calm as the pressure increases. It’s also key to listen to your team members. Leadership qualities are great, but it’s also important to show you can listen to others and support their ideas if they make sense.”
    </div>
    <div class="boldSection">
      Know what you want and why you want it.
    </div>
    <div class="normalText">
      “When you interview with a certain business division, give a sense that you already know all about Morgan Stanley and what you’re looking for. Go in, introduce yourself, say what you think you can offer Morgan Stanley, and tell us why you’re interested in that business division.”

    <div class="normalText">
      If you’re trying out for a business like investment banking, have a good understanding of what investment banking is. Hint: it’s a lot more than just mergers & acquisitions and IPOs. Find out before you interview what new entrants do in this business - the kinds of skills we’d love you to have from the get-go and let us know you have them.
    </div>
    <div class="boldSection">
      Have an opinion.
    </div>
    <div class="normalText">
      Be up to speed on current events in the finance industry. It’s good to know if there’s a big IPO or M&A deal in the news on the day of your interview, and if there is, come prepared to comment on it.
    </div>
    <div class="boldSection">
      Don’t fake it.
    </div>
    <div class="normalText">
      Don’t act overly enthusiastic. Any extreme enthusiasm comes across as you trying to impress me too much. Be comfortable with yourself, polite and engaging. Apart from your skills, we are also trying to evaluate whether you’d pass “The Airplane Test”: would you be pleasant to be around for long periods of time.
    </div>
    <div class="boldSection">
      Show that you have a life.
    </div>
    <div class="normalText">
      Academic success is important, but so are signs that you have passions outside of work. It’s good to see that you can manage your time well enough to have both good grades and a life.
    </div>
    <div class="boldSection">
