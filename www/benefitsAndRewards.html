      ‘25 Best Big Companies to Work For’ and ‘Top 50 Companies For Women’ lists. The votes came from the people who really
      count – our own colleagues – so it’s a big win for us, which shows our efforts are really paying off.

      Learning and development in Santander is as important to us as it is to you. Just as our customers expect a first-class service you can expect learning and development opportunities that are first-class; providing the support to manage your career development and achieve your own personal ambitions.
    </div>
    <div class="normalText">
      We approach your learning journey as a partnership. Developing your skills and knowledge is going to be critical to your success, and we'll ensure you learn to excel in looking after our customers. That might mean attending a course, using an online package or being coached by an experienced member of staff.
    </div>
    <div class="normalText">
      We're strictly governed by policies and laws, so for certain roles such as those that involve giving advice on products, we make sure everyone is up to speed. Working with some of the best training experts in the fields, you’ll undergo formal training – both in the classroom, and in a live environment – and you'll need to pass tests to prove you know your stuff. We're serious about getting it right, so we’re looking for people who take learning seriously.
    </div>
    <div class="normalText">
      Once you're settled in, we'll want you to think about your future and how you drive your personal development. It helps to think ahead and ensure that your career is moving in the right direction. We'll support you by providing access to a wide range of training opportunities and learning materials to help you learn new skills. Most importantly, it’s all about giving you room to grow – speaking to you directly, finding out your ambitions and setting out a clear path – with objectives, areas for development and real opportunities to get there.
