    <div class="q">
      What did you do before you came to JPMorgan?
    </div>
    <div class="a">
      I’ve been here my whole career. But I got interested in sustainable investing when I was in college.
      When I studied abroad, I wanted to see if microloans would work there. In Shanghai, there’s a bustling
      suiting market—tons of local tailors that can make you anything. Most of the people in Asia can invest
      in a sewing machine or cloth, but what they needed was more business. I thought, “Wow, this is a great
      value proposition for people.” Especially women, who usually don’t do custom suiting, or men who can’t
      afford to get a bespoke suit when they’re in college. So I started a small business where I got orders
      for these tailors. It wasn’t expensive at all, but that was a lot of money for a Chinese tailor.
    </div>
    <div class="q">
      How would you describe your role at JPMorgan?
    </div>
    <div class="a">
      I work within the Equity Model Portfolio Solutions team for Wealth Management Investment Resources.
      I’m the lead research analyst for the sustainable impact portfolio. My job is to manage model portfolios
      of individual equities. All of our division’s portfolios are defensive, long-term oriented, high-quality
      and concentrated. The sustainable impact portfolio is no different but it aligns with seven key
      sustainability themes. If a client is interested in climate change, water scarcity, waste management,
      food availability, health and wellness, improving lives and aging population—we actually pick securities
      that address those themes.
    </div>
    <div class="q">
      What’s a project you’ve worked on that excited you?
    </div>
    <div class="a">
      Before my current role, I worked in collaboration the Global Sustainable Finance Group. We helped structure
      and launch the Investing with Impact Platform, which is offered to financial advisors that wanted to invest
      sustainably. And that’s really what got me interested in sustainable investing. I think what’s really cool
      is that four years after working on that project, I actually run a product now that’s focused on doing that
      as well. It’s kind of come full circle, thinking about what it means to do good without compromising
      returns.
    </div>
    <div class="q">
      What was it like starting at JPMorgan?
    </div>
    <div class="a">
      I started off as a summer intern and I haven’t left since. It’s always been very collegial. You get a lot
      of opportunities if you raise your hand and you’re passionate. I actually asked my manager last summer if
      I could put together a proposal for a new sustainable portfolio, because as an asset category,
      sustainable investing has grown over 76% in the last three years. I’ve always felt like my manager has
      encouraged me to do more, even when it might seem like too much responsibility for a young person. But
      they were willing to let me take a shot at it. Lo and behold, we launched the portfolio a few months ago.
      It’s a very ownership-driven culture.
    </div>
    <div class="q">
      What’s a typical day at the office for you?
    </div>
    <div class="a">
      The majority of my time is focused on reading, research, and meetings with other parts of the firm. Our
      team has a very good relationship with JPMorgan’s institutional research department and we talk a
      lot with our sell side research analysts. A predominant amount of my time is focused on trying to
      synthesize all that information and put it in a portfolio context: where should we be positioned in the
      portfolio? Where do we see attractive risk-reward opportunities in individual stocks?
    </div>
    <div class="q">
      What are your hobbies and interests and passions outside of work?
    </div>
    <div class="a">
      I really enjoy dancing and horseback riding. Outside of that, I’m a chapter president for the alumni
      association of the Gates Millennium Scholars Program. I work a lot with minority students, trying to
      help them in professional development and in networking. That’s really close to my heart, because if
      it wasn’t for the Gates Foundation, I wouldn’t have received the scholarship that helped me go to college.
    </div>
    <div class="q">
      What would you say to a student considering a career at JPMorgan?
    </div>
    <div class="a">
      I would say is that our firm is actually very creative. I think a lot of kids think, “To be creative,
      I have to work in tech.” That’s not true. My portfolio, for example was a creative idea that became a
      product I think is going to be very much in demand. When you join a firm that’s global in reach; we
      have lots of divisions and lots of roles. There’s opportunity for all kinds of students and what fits
      their skillset. It's a great place that fosters innovative ideas and innovative solutions for our clients.
      I wouldn’t limit JPMorgan to just an investment bank just for investment bankers. It’s really a
      place for anyone.
