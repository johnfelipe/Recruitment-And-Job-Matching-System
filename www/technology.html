      HOW WE WORK
      </div>
      <div class="normalText">
      Goldman Sachs Technology is responsible for full life-cycle systems implementation through our worldwide operations. Our frontline technology business units are aligned to specific client businesses—sales and trading, banking, investment management and investment research—as well as firmwide operations such as legal, compliance, controllers and human capital management.

      All of our technology solutions are built on a rich collection of enterprise and client platforms that unify and standardize our approaches to development, testing, workflow, user interfaces, the Web and more. At the core of our organization, infrastructure engineers design scalable hardware solutions to ensure we can meet the needs of our business, worldwide, 24X7.

      We typically work in small to mid-sized teams, often globally distributed, focusing on specific business needs. New hires and senior technologists work together in a flat structure where “the best idea wins.” Individual initiative is encouraged, and it is not uncommon for junior technologists to be given broad responsibilities.

      Given the ever-changing nature of our business, we ultimately need our technology teams to adapt and respond to change quickly, while actively pursuing new opportunities. As a result, we expect their skill-sets to evolve constantly over time, and provide many resources for our people to both learn new technologies and take on new roles and assignments.
